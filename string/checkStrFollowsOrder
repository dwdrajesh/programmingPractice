Q. Asked in Facebook interview.

Given an input string and a pattern, check if characters in the input string follows the same order as determined by characters present in the pattern. 
Assume there wonâ€™t be any duplicate characters in the pattern.

Input: 
string = "engineers rock"
pattern = "er";
Output: true
Explanation: 
All 'e' in the input string are before all 'r'.

Input: 
string = "engineers rock"
pattern = "egr";
Output: false
Explanation: 
There are two 'e' after 'g' in the input string.



Follow the Set 3 for a simpler approach using label[256] = {-1};
Follow Set 1 for an iterative approach that goes over the pattern's chars two at a time and checks if the last occurence of the first char in pattern is after 
the first occurence of the 2nd character. This needs the C++ string's find_first_of() method though.
